This project is a 2D CAD application built with Quasar and Vue. It allows you to draw lines, rectangles, circles, and dimensions on a canvas. It also allows you to save and load drawings, configurations are saved to local storage.
We use Quasar components for the UI whenever possible, unless better options are available.
Keep shared code in separate files, such as components, stores, and utils.
Prefer composition API over options API.
Use pinia for state management.
Leave comments in the code for important information and future reference.
Comments should be easily understood by an AI agent.
Update related comments when code changes.
